# API Reference

The AppsDock OS API is based on REST. The API provides resource oriented endpoint URLs. The endpoints accept form-encoded and JSON-encoded request bodies and response JSON-encoded data. In general, endpoints are secured by auth tokens which can be issued via the authentication API. The request of secured endpoints requires the token (bearer) in each request as authorization header.
