# Naming convention

## Classes

Class names are written in **CamelCase** notation. Class names should be as meaningful as possible.

If a class name contains an abbreviation, **API** becomes **Api** and **SQL** becomes **Sql** for example.

### Exceptions

If an abbreviation stands alone or is at the end of the class name, it is written in capital letters like **API**, **DI**, **RestAPI** or **ExtendedHTML**.

## Methods

Method names are written in **CamelCase** notation. Method names should be as meaningful as possible.

If a method name contains an abbreviation, **API** becomes **Api** and **SQL** becomes **Sql** for example.

### Exceptions

If an abbreviation stands alone or is at the end of the method name, it is written in capital letters like **API**, **DI**, **RestAPI** or **ExtendedHTML**.
